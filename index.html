    <p>
      Greetings Samuel, hope you're doing well and feeling well if
      thats the case may God add more to it. I just wanted to send this letter 
      to you as a letter of encouragement from an older friend as you're nearing the end of
      your university years and approaching the stressful exams. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I want you to know that even with the exams fast approaching, 
      the final year projects obviously being tiring and lecturers 
      breathing down your neck left and right for you to complete your projects
      dont't give in to the stress and give up, try your best and you'll surely
      be rewarded. 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, of course i hope nothing for you but the absolute best and wish nothing for you but success
      in the future. Good luck, and remember have fun.
    </p>
  </div>
